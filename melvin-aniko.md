First of all, we would like to thank you for confirming our RSVP.

We know it's a little late but we wanted to officially ask you if you could please be part of our wedding entourage as the **Cord Sponsors** for the ceremony on the 4th April 2026.

In regards to colour/theme while we don't want you to feel pressured in getting more clothes, it would be appreciated if you can wear:
| Aniko | Melvin |
|------|--------|
| Dusty blue dress | Grey suit and dusty blue neck tie |
